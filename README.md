### Architecting Scalable & Resilient Systems | MTUCI Student

Hello! I'm Said, a Computer Science student at MTUCI with a deep passion for backend engineering. My journey has taken me from foundational programming concepts to designing and implementing complex, distributed-ready systems. I thrive on building software that is not just functional, but also **robust, scalable, and a pleasure to maintain**.

My main focus is on the **Java & Spring ecosystem**, where I enjoy architecting clean, modular applications. This culminated in my latest project, a fully-fledged e-commerce platform, which served as my personal masterclass in applying modern architectural patterns, comprehensive testing strategies, and CI/CD automation.

## 🗺️ My Learning Roadmap

My goal is to continuously deepen my expertise in building large-scale, resilient systems. Here's what's next on my list:

1.  **Evolve the Monolith:** Deconstruct my e-commerce platform into true microservices, replacing the internal event bus with **Kafka** and introducing **Spring Cloud Gateway** for routing. *(Target: Q4 2024)*
2.  **Master Container Orchestration:** Containerize the new microservices and deploy them on a **Kubernetes** cluster, managing the deployment with **Helm** charts. *(Target: Q1 2025)*
3.  **Dive into Observability:** Instrument my services with **Micrometer**, collect metrics with **Prometheus**, and build monitoring dashboards in **Grafana** to understand system performance in real-time. *(Target: Q1 2025)*
4.  **Explore Reactive Programming:** Re-implement a high-throughput service (like a real-time notification service) using **Spring WebFlux** and **Project Reactor**. *(Target: Q2 2025)*
