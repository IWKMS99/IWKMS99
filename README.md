### Architecting Scalable & Resilient Systems | MTUCI Student

Hello! I'm Said, a Computer Science student at MTUCI with a deep passion for backend engineering. My journey has taken me from foundational programming concepts to designing and implementing complex, distributed-ready systems. I thrive on building software that is not just functional, but also **robust, scalable, and a pleasure to maintain**.

My main focus is on the **Java & Spring ecosystem**, where I enjoy architecting clean, modular applications. This culminated in my latest project, a fully-fledged e-commerce platform, which served as my personal masterclass in applying modern architectural patterns, comprehensive testing strategies, and CI/CD automation.
